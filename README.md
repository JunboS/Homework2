random numbers and visualization.  
1a.py script generates 1000 random numbers over 0-100.  
1b.py script generates another 1000 new random numbers from the output of 1a using the equation y = 3x + 6.  
1c.py script visualizes the results from 1a and 1b.  
Q5_call_scripts.ipynb script shows the 3 steps by calling 1a, 1b, and 1c.  
Q5_show_scripts.ipynb script shows the 3 steps by showing the code from 1a, 1b, and 1c.
